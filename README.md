# Machine Learning Model to Predict Generous Customers

## 1. Overview

This project compares two alternative machine learning models, **XGBoost** and **Random Forest**, in order to find the best predictor for the problem of identifying *generous* customers. For the purpose of this project a customer will be classified as *generous* if their tip amount is equal or greater than 20% of the predicted fare for a given ride. Additionally, it is needed to train a linear regression model that estimates the fare before hand.
